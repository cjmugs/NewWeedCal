        <p id="hello">Hello and welcome.</p>
        <p>This is a Illinois recreational Weed tax calculator that I have built for everyone to use in Illinois.</p>
        <p>This calculator is designed to calculate the total recreational taxes to be collected,<br>
        as well as any discounts that might apply.
        <br>Discounts that might apply are Veteran discount, daily discounts and loyalty points</p>

        <ol>
        <h2>How to use Calculator</h2>
        <li>Enter the total price BEFORE discounts.</li>
         <li>Then enter any loyalty points.</li>
        <li>Then enter percentage of THC.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's all and then the calculator will compute the totals with taxes and
            <br>if there are any discounts that apply.</p>
